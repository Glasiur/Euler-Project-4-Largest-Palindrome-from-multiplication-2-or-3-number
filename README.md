# Euler-Project-4-Largest-Palindrome-from-multiplication-2-or-3-number
This project contains optimized methods to find the largest palindrome smaller than a number ùëÅ‚â•0, such that it is the product of 2 or 3 numbers with n digits.\n
This repository contains the necessary tools to test the optimization and validity of a solution to the problem of finding the largest palindrome resulting from the multiplication of 2 or 3 numbers.
